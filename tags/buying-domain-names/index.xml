  &lt;p&gt;
    Domains are relatively easy to purchase: You just head over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;your favorite registrar&lt;/a&gt;, type in the domain you’re interested in, and as long as it’s available, it can be yours with a few clicks of a button. But the real work comes &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you make your purchase..
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you want to register a great domain name that will set you up for success in the long run, perform these things to do before buying a domain before hitting the “&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;Purchase&lt;/span&gt;” button.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Give yourself time to really think about your domain name before committing to one
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Things to do before buying a domain. Your first idea for a domain name may not be your best one. Give yourself time to think over possibilities and come up with several options to choose from. After all, a great domain name is the foundation of a good website. It should be memorable, easy to type, and effectively share your brand. Also, think beyond traditional domain endings and consider using a New Domain. Not only does it offer you the chance to create a uniquely branded URL, but it also has a lot more availability than traditional domain names.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Determine how you’ll be using your domain
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Things to do before buying a domain. You have several options for how to use your domain once it’s registered. The most obvious way to use it is as the primary URL for a new website—but that’s not your only option. You can maximize your online presence by pointing your domain to a variety of other places. Highlight a specific section of your website through a customized domain (for example, showcase your philanthropy efforts with a yoursite.gives domain), or make it easy for new followers to find you on social media with a yoursite.social domain name.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Make sure you’re not infringing on someone else’s trademark
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Things to do before buying a domain. There’s always a possibility that the brilliant, perfect, one-of-a-kind domain name you’ve come up with isn’t as unique as you thought. If it turns out that your domain is the same or very similar to trademarked content, you could be in big trouble down the road. It’s worth the extra effort to do your research ahead of time to make sure you aren’t infringing upon someone else’s intellectual property. A quick Google search is a good place to start, but you can also use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uspto.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website&lt;/a&gt; to do more in-depth research. Nolo.com also offers a comprehensive guide for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/avoid-trademark-infringement-domain-name-29032.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;understanding if your domain name infringes on a trademark&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    See if social handles of the same (or a similar) name are available
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Social media is now an essential part of curating an online presence. You want it to be as easy as possible for your website visitors to find and follow you on other social networks. Having a consistent handle across your website and social media accounts streamlines your online presence and is a great way to brand yourself. With the right tools, it doesn’t take a lot of work to determine if a name is available across the board. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.name.com/blog/business/social-media-2/2015/09/rembrandt-social-media-branding-made-easy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Download the Chrome extension Rembrandt&lt;/a&gt; and whenever you search for a domain name on intispace.com, you’ll automatically see if the same handles are available on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.
  &lt;/p&gt;
