      <title>Make Your Domain Name More Dynamic</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/make-your-domain-name-more-dynamic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems a simple question, but are you using your domain name to advertise your business? You’ve spent some time coming up with it, but how much are you publicizing it? Read on to find out how to effectively utilize your domain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising by its definition is transient.  Fifteen years ago few people would have even known what you meant when you said the word ‘domain’.  Today every brand and company is expected to utilize the internet. What’s the simplest way of doing this? Use your domain name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity in advertising is one of its attributes that make some ads art. In fact, if all you did was plaster your domain name everywhere you would not end up with desirable results, so there’s advertising’s value in one sentence! Advertising requires creativity, teamwork, brainstorming and much more. With that said, in certain circumstances all you really can do is display your domain name. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many instances advertising space is limited. For example, advertising in a football stadium or other large venue is extremely expensive. Every advertisement in this type of environment needs to send a message to the appropriate audience, but only using a very limited space (more space = higher advertising cost). The most economical way to send a message &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; include a call to action is by showcasing your domain name. This gives your audience a way to act rather than just enjoy your witty advertisement and struggle to remember your brand after!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.midphase.comm/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gtlds/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases you may only be able to include your domain name! This is another reason why it is crucial to purchase the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/2015/03/how-to-come-up-with-the-perfect-domain/&#34;&gt;ideal domain name for your business&lt;/a&gt;. Do whatever it takes to land the name of your business plus a .com, .biz or other &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/2015/03/a-glance-of-top-level-domains-and-subdomains/&#34;&gt;TLD (Top Level Domain)&lt;/a&gt;. More and more TLDs are being released every single month in order to give business owners a wider range of options for domain names. If your business is called ‘example’ and example.com is already taken, look for example.net or .info or anything else that may be related to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banner Ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a domain name that fits your company, you can use that name to effectively advertise. Banner ads are effective  when it comes to promoting your domain around the web. These inexpensive ads are a great way to spread your name and get traffic to your website. Clicking on the ad leads the user to your site, but having your domain name on the ad can leave an impression even if they don’t want to leave the site they’re already viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strange Advertising Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have taken up an offer to have a stall at an event. It could be a ballgame or a school fair, so your options for advertising are slim. Make sure what chances you do have imprints your brand domain on people’s mind. Those great cupcakes? “We got them from that stall, what was the name? caketreats.com wasn’t it?”. You see the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Seven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an old rule in advertising called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.krusecontrolinc.com/how-social-media-beats-other-forms-of-marketing-rule-of-7/&#34;&gt;‘Rule of Seven’.&lt;/a&gt; This means that a consumer needs to see your message, or in this case your domain name, at least seven times before they’ll commit it to memory. This is why having your domain name on banner ads is a great way to spread your name. Other simple examples are business cards, fliers, social networking platforms and anywhere else you can fit your domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Easy to Spell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that domains of nine letters or fewer are successful. Think of combining two words: ‘you’ and ‘tube’; ‘face’ and ‘book’. Add words on to the end to make it memorable.  Another tip is to ensure your domain is easy to spell. A big part of advertising is word of mouth. How many times has someone said to you “I’ve seen this great shop online”, then struggles to spell the domain? Tell ten people your domain, and ask them to spell it. If it is catchy and easy to spell, then it will stick in people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we see it, if you’re advertising in any way you have no reason not to include your domain name. It is your easiest – and cheapest – call to action, and these days everyone recognizes a domain name when they see one. &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;Intispace Netmedia&lt;/a&gt; is focused on helping you and your clients come up with the perfect domain names. &lt;strong&gt;Keep checking the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com&#34;&gt;intispace blog&lt;/a&gt; for more upcoming tips on starting your own business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Come Up With The Perfect Domain</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/03/how-to-come-up-with-the-perfect-domain/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 07:37:23 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/03/how-to-come-up-with-the-perfect-domain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is looking for the perfect name for a business. Do you know what makes a perfect domain name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty simple. All you need to do is come up with a catchy name for your business, throw a .com at the end of it, and behold, you have a perfect domain name for your up-and-coming reseller web hosting business! If only it were that easy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain name should be simple. Think of all of the websites that you visit frequently: Google.com, php.net, facebook.com. All of these sites are very basic and easy to remember. This of course is ideal, but it can be difficult to be able to land the exact domain that you are after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People get into the web hosting reseller industry for various reasons. Web developers, for example, may want to offer web hosting services to their clients. This gives the developer the opportunity to market and sell all of the web services that a client will need (design, development, hosting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other resellers want to start their own small web hosting company to take advantage of the growing industry. Web hosting is a fast-paced field that increases as more and more websites are created every single day. Although the growth is predictable, that’s not to say that you don’t need to know how to market your business to have success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what the reason is for choosing to be a reseller, your new (or old but looking to be improved) business needs that perfect name. If you already have a perfect name for your business, go for it! Follow these simple steps and work on obtaining a perfect domain. If you are yet to come up with an original name for your reseller business, it may be a good idea to consider what your domain will be at the same time that you name your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that contribute to the perfect domain name. We’ve come up with a few tips and tricks to come up with a domain that is easy for your customers to recognize, will work well from an SEO viewpoint, and will be convenient for you and your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are seven tips to keep in mind when coming up with a domain name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it simple. &lt;/strong&gt;As mentioned before, you want to keep your domain name (and business’s name for that matter) as simple and short as possible. In today’s expanding world of business, that may not be as easy as it sounds. The key is to find that balance between having a creative name that sticks out to customers, but isn’t too difficult to remember. Avoid having too many words in your domain. One word is ideal, two is great, three is manageable, and anything more could be detrimental.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about a hyphen? &lt;/strong&gt;Many people debate whether or not a hyphen is advantageous. From one point of view, it may give you a close alternative to the domain you want even though a competitor already has the actual domain you are after. The problem of having a hyphen in your domain is that it can disrupt SEO results and can also confuse a potential client. He or she may end up at your competitor’s site rather than your own. There are occasions when a hyphen may be your only choice, but avoid using them if at all possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate versions. &lt;/strong&gt;If the domain name you want is unavailable, you may need to settle for something similar, such as adding the word “the” or making your name plural. However, if you’re going to tweak your domain just a bit, such as making it “theexamplewebdesign.com” rather than “examplewebdesign.com,” make sure to market your business as The Example Web Design. Otherwise, your clients may get confused and go to the wrong site. Again, do everything possible to keep your domain name and business name identical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid words that are hard to spell. &lt;/strong&gt;Try not to include words that may be hard for clients to spell. Consider looking at this list of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/spelling-and-word-lists/misspelled.html&#34;&gt;100 most misspelled words&lt;/a&gt; in the English language. If one of these words is in your anticipated domain name, it is worth reconsidering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be descriptive. &lt;/strong&gt;Although some of the largest technology companies in the world don’t have descriptive names, e.g. Samsung and Apple, your aspiring business does not have the same background as these technological giants. If you’re in web design, make it apparent. If you’re starting a blogging as business, let it be known. There’s no mistaking that &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;Intispace.com&lt;/a&gt; specializes in web development. Give your business the advantage by telling potential clients exactly what it is you have to offer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLD. &lt;/strong&gt;Choosing a TLD, or Top-Level Domain, can be tricky but very beneficial if done right. (Click &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/2015/03/a-glance-of-top-level-domains-and-subdomains/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed description of TLDs.) A few years ago, it was a no-brainer to try and snag a .com TLD for any business. Now, hundreds of new and unique TLDs are being released to account for the growth of online business. If the .com domain that you’re looking for is already taken, consider exploring new options. The newly released TLDs are becoming more and more popular and may provide your business with the distinction that you’re looking for. Some sensible options for resellers are .graphics, .business, and .services. Click &lt;a href=&#34;http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find the most up-to-date list of gTLDs that ICANN has released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t hesitate.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have an idea for a domain name, don’t wait around to purchase it. Domain names go quick and you never want to miss out by only a couple of months while you’re finalizing your business plans. Purchase the domain first, then take care of other details. If you have a couple of ideas for domain names, it’s worth buying both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult (and unrealistic at times) to be able to follow &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these guidelines. However, do everything you can to come up with a simple domain name that describes your business well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not in the web development industry, consider applying these same tips to find a perfect domain name for whatever industry you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reselling web hosting and domains is an exciting opportunity that can open doors to clients all over the world. When done correctly, reselling web hosting – whether as a package with other services or just the web hosting alone – can be a very profitable business. Keep checking the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com&#34;&gt;intispace blog&lt;/a&gt; for more upcoming tips on starting your own business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Glance of Top-Level Domains And Subdomains</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/03/a-glance-of-top-level-domains-and-subdomains/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:43:50 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/03/a-glance-of-top-level-domains-and-subdomains/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A perfect domain name may be just what you and your clients need. Take a look at what exactly TLDs and Subdomains are and what they can do for your business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post about the behind-the-scenes details of DNS. In that post, I went through how your browser finds the web page you’re looking for by simply typing in a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain is the unique name/title of your website. It’s what your clients will associate with your business. Apple.com, for example, is the domain name for the dominant computer company, Apple. Seems pretty obvious, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your business and your clients’ business to have the absolute best domain for whatever you or your clients might be selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re in the food catering industry. Catering.com seems like the perfect fit, right? The problem here of course is that there can only be one catering.com in the entire world. A company already owns the domain catering.com and has it registered. For the time being, no other business can use food.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for you, there are numerous options available for a relevant domain for your catering business. To understand the different routes you can take to find the perfect domain, we first need to understand the difference between top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains and subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS functions as a hierarchy: it begins with the top-level domain, followed by the second-level domain, then finally, the subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Level Domain (TLD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TLD is the last word or sequence of letters in a domain. Some of the most recognized TLDs are .com, .uk, .net, .org and .edu. Under the direction of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icann.org/&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, each TLD is registered by a specific organization. ICANN breaks down all TLDs into four separate categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic top-level domains (gTLD).&lt;/strong&gt; These domains are the most recognizable, with .com, .org, .edu and so on. Before 2014, there were only 22 different gTLDs. Now, ICANN has released 100s of domains, including some as radical as .ninja and .hiphop. The reason behind this is that as the internet grows, domains will become harder and harder to obtain. New TLDs give aspiring businesses the opportunity to have a relevant domain name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country code top-level domains (ccTLD).&lt;/strong&gt; Country Code TLDs are operated privately and are specifically designated for particular countries. They are reserved to serve communities. The ccTLDs are made up of two letters. Some common examples are .us, .uk, .cn and .au.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationalized country code top-level domains.&lt;/strong&gt; These domains are similar to the ccTLDs, but are geared more towards countries that use the Arabic alphabet or non-alphabetic writing systems such as Japanese. An example is  &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1.&#34;&gt;مصر&lt;/a&gt;, which is reserved for Egypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure top-level domain.&lt;/strong&gt; This group consists of only one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA). It is used exclusively for technical infrastructure purposes. This TLD is simply .arpa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can register a domain with many different companies, but all eventually link back to ICANN to form a database of all TLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second-Level Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second-level domains are like the core of a domain name in that it is directly below the top-level domain. The second-level domain is generally associated with the organization that is registered to the domain name. If we look at the domain,&lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;www.intispace.com&lt;/a&gt;, “intispace” is the second-level domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subdomain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subdomain is exactly what is sounds like: a domain that is part of a larger domain. Subdomains are read from left to right and are separated by dots. We commonly see this with email. For example, mail.google.com will take you to your Gmail account. Another common example of a subdomain is if there are separate divisions within an organization or business, such as support.example.com or finance.example.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subdomains should not be confused with subdirectories. Subdirectories are files and folders that are part of a domain, such as resell.biz/domain-reseller/. The part of the domain: /domain-reseller/ is a file of resell.biz, not a subdomain. Subdomains always come before the TLD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.catering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have explored the different parts of a domain name, we can go back to our example of a catering business and find a perfect domain name. Within ICANN is a department called Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA. IANA focuses on maintaining the codes and numbering systems involved with the internet. The IANA keeps a Root Zone Database that contains all of the gTLDs available. You can find the list &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently enough, .catering is an available TLD. We can now move forward and include the second-level domain: the name of the business. For our example, we’ll choose the name “Logan Valley.” A perfect domain name would be loganvalley.catering. We can check the availability of this domain by searching on virtually any domain name reseller’s website. I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://panel.intispace.com/&#34;&gt;panel.intispace.com&lt;/a&gt;, to search the availability of slipi.catering. You can test your future domain by clicking &lt;a href=&#34;http://panel.intispace.com/domain-registration/index.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for this example, loganvalley.catering is (at time of writing) available. You can purchase the domain and web hosting services, design your website, and have your online business up and running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your business grows, you may want to add subdomains. You could add a sales.loganvalley.catering, services.loganvalley.catering and info.loganvalley.catering. These subdomains will all function under the domain name loganvalley.catering. Subdomains are generally easy to set up once you own the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although domain names now may seem more complicated than just your business’s name plus a .com, it really is easy to find the perfect domain for you. Explore different options. If you want to stick with a .com TLD you may need to adjust your second-level domain just a bit. We suggest looking into new TLDs that will help boost your business. A unique domain name may just be what your business needs to really take off.&lt;/p&gt;
