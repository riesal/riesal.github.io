    <p>The question of whether or not you should do your own bookkeeping really comes down to a couple of things.</p>

<p><div id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1459961244674_59168" class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2">

      Bookkeeping is an extremely time consuming and tedious task. If you are in the early stages, you are most likely stretching yourself as it is&#8211;perhaps trying to manage your marketing, sales, PR, customer service, and inventory all at the same time. As a startup, we understand the &#8220;hustle&#8221; mentality.</p>

      The term &#8220;bookkeeping&#8221; might conjure up scenes from a classic gangster flick, with back-alley deals, horse betting, and offers &#8220;you can&#8217;t refuse.&#8221; But the reality is that this couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth. Sure, we have our fair share of excitement—an unreconciled transaction or an uncategorized charge (we kid, we kid). Bookkeeping is an arduous and time consuming process, a marathon that begins the day you open for business, to the day you (hopefully never) close your doors.<br /></p>

    <p>Anyone who has ever worked with PHP, Apache or MySQL Web applications is aware of how quickly vulnerabilities can surface and become widespread problems. Security and vulnerability testing are standard among many of these application types because they&#8217;re frequently used. Consequently, attackers target these types of apps. Every system is vulnerable, making it nearly impossible to keep up with all of the security updates manually.</p>
