                    <p>One of the most economical and secure ways to protect your website on affordable hosting platforms is to deploy a private Secure Socket Layer (SSL) on you’re your website giving the instant ability to roll out protected URLs like <a href="https://www.mysite.com/">https://www.mysite.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you are still in doubt as to what an SSL actually does consider this explanation from <a href="http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=how-ssl-works">Symantec</a> on the digital handshake that takes place between a browser and a server:</p>

<ol>
<li>A browser attempts to connect to a website secured with SSL.</li>
<li>The browser requests that the web server identify itself.</li>
<li>The server sends the browser a copy of its SSL certificate.</li>
<li>The browser checks whether it trusts the SSL certificate. If so, it sends a message to the server.</li>
<li>The server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgement to start an SSL 7 encrypted session.</li>
<li>Encrypted data is shared between the browser and the server</li>
</ol>

<p>Your site receives a permanent “security guard” which protects users in an online transaction, and encrypts data during transmission giving you, said Symantec, a “trillion year head start over a hacker.”</p>

<p>“At current computing speeds, a hacker with the time, tools, and motivation to attack using brute force would require a trillion years to break into a session protected by an SGC-enabled certificate,” said Symantec.</p>

<p>“To enable strong encryption for the most site visitors, choose an SSL Certificate that enables 128-bit minimum encryption for 99.9 percent of website visitors.”</p>

<p>But there are other benefits, too, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Credentials establish identity online</li>
<li>Authentication generates trust in credential</li>
</ul>

<p>SSL certificates on Intispace platforms are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signed by Comodo, Geotrust, RapidSSL, Certum, Thawte, Symantec</li>
<li>99.3% compatibility with browsers</li>
<li>256-bit encryption</li>
<li>Lock appears in browser</li>
</ul>
