                    <p>If you’ve ever had to move, you know how difficult it can be. It doesn’t matter if you’re moving your website to a new host or your family to a new house. Even if your current location causes you a lot of stress, the pain of moving somewhere new can make it seem worthwhile to stay in a place you’re not happy. Moving doesn’t have to be a massive difficulty for you, however.</p>

<p>My old friend, Christian Dubois moved his houses earlier this week. To help alleviate the pain, he hired professionals. He did research on moving companies, discovering that many hire part-time or seasonal employees. That terrified him. Some people may say stuff is just stuff, but it’s my stuff and much of it is very important to me. He was hiring professionals to reduce his stress, not simply replace it with the worry that inexperienced movers might break things.</p>

<p>Moving hosting sucks, make sure your movers are professionals. When people move from an old host to Intispace, we know the process can be stressful. No one wants to escape a bad host only to find their website doesn’t work properly on the new one. That’s why we train our expert staff to move people safely and effectively.</p>

<p>Whether it’s your home, your business, or your website, moving sucks. Working with trusted professionals like Intispace lets you relax while they take care of all the heavy lifting.</p>
