      <title>Get the AWS EC2 instance metadata</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/get-the-aws-ec2-instance-metadata/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the AWS EC2 instance metadata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you are ready to send the first commands to your EC2 linux instance. Let’s check the EC2 instance metadata by hitting a specific AWS node only available from within the instance itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;more-4512&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. You can list all instance metadata by issuing the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://d2wxe3cu71edbr.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/lab-step/aws-ec2-api-7f27ea40-e554-4524-bc59-f2cfe515c93a.png&#34; alt=&#34;AWS EC2 metadata: services list&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily check the list of security groups attached to the instance, its ID, the hostname, or the ID of the used AMI. These commands are extremely useful when you want to automate the setup of new instances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/security-groups&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/security-groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://d2wxe3cu71edbr.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/lab-step/aws-ec2-api-2-225b554d-924d-457b-a62f-3bf8f60ae329.png&#34; alt=&#34;AWS EC2 metadata&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can also get the public key of the attached Keypair using the public-keys metadata:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;curl -w &amp;ldquo;\n&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-keys/0/openssh-key&#34;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-keys/0/openssh-key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Everything Entrepreneurs Should Know About Bookkeeping – Part 2</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/07/everything-entrepreneurs-know-bookkeeping-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2016 04:26:43 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2016/07/everything-entrepreneurs-know-bookkeeping-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question of whether or not you should do your own bookkeeping really comes down to a couple of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1459961244674_59168&#34; class=&#34;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&#34; data-block-type=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;sqs-block-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bookkeeping is an extremely time consuming and tedious task. If you are in the early stages, you are most likely stretching yourself as it is&amp;#8211;perhaps trying to manage your marketing, sales, PR, customer service, and inventory all at the same time. As a startup, we understand the &amp;#8220;hustle&amp;#8221; mentality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Does your accounting experience boil down to a couple of college courses? Have you ever taken the time to get to the state and federal tax codes that apply to you? Are you familiar with the term &amp;#8220;nexus&amp;#8221;?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Many business owners think they have what it takes to do their own books, and they very well might. But chances are, most business owners overestimate their &amp;#8220;expertise&amp;#8221; when it comes to proper accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Side note: &lt;/strong&gt;On a philosophical level, you also need to ask yourself, what makes you happiest. Why did you start your business? Was it to categorize transactions, or was it to fulfill a need, explore your passions, share your gifts, better a product, or change the world?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Chances are that you didn&amp;#8217;t become a business owner so you could practice bookkeeping. Hiring a bookkeeper will allow you to focus on the real reason you decided to put blood and tears into your product.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h4&gt;
      What are the Different Bookkeeping Services Available?
    &lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1459961244674_28747&#34; class=&#34;sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image&#34; data-block-type=&#34;5&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1459961244674_28970&#34; class=&#34;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&#34; data-block-type=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;sqs-block-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;The O.G. or “Traditional” Bookkeeping Services: Accounting Firms&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      The most traditional method of bookkeeping is to hire an accountant or accounting firm. (We’re talking local mom and pop shops and freelancers.) These guys offer great benefits over the DIY self method—like the fact that you’ll barely have to lift a finger and you’ll also be privy to expert insight (pending their qualifications of course).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Of course there are also some drawbacks with these bookkeeping services, such as higher fees and slow turn around times. Many of these institutions charge high hourly fees for consultations which can make it difficult to set a steady course for your monthly budget, not to mention their services can often be “behind the times” in terms of integrating technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      When it comes to the traditional method, business owners will have to consider whether or not they want to hire an in-house bookkeeper or an external accounting firm. Both methods can be expensive with hourly consulting fees and salary/benefit considerations for in-house hires. In-house accountants can be a solid option if you own a large operation and need constant oversight. Smaller businesses however, might find that the costs don’t outweigh the rewards when it comes to hiring a full-time accountant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;sqs-block-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;The &amp;#8220;Semi-Traditional” Bookkeeping Service: DIY Software&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      DIY software is an increasingly popular option, giving business owners a great UI to track their finances. Companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://quickbooks.intuit.com&#34;&gt;Quickbooks&lt;/a&gt; provide robust software that can help facilitate advanced accounting functions. Not only are many of these types of tools extremely helpful, they can also save money when it comes to hiring a traditional accountant. Although this is a great option for &lt;em&gt;accountants&lt;/em&gt;, it may not be optimal for business owners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Having a good piece of software doesn’t make you knowledgeable about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pajak.net/info/indonesian_tax_system.htm&#34;&gt;Indonesia tax code&lt;/a&gt;, regulations or requirements. Business owners can miss out on deductions, disqualify themselves as a compliant business, and face IRS auditing through improper tax filing. Having simply taken an accounting class in college is no substitute for the wealth of knowledge an accountant brings to the table.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Even if you feel confident enough in your accounting, there is still the consideration of time. Anyone who has started a business knows that they will soon find themselves being pulled in lot’s of different directions. Bookkeeping is a time consuming task—business owners need to ask if reconciling transactions is the best use of their time. A more honest labeling of &amp;#8220;DIY&amp;#8221; software is not a bookkeeping service, rather a bookkeeping &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1459961244674_44334&#34; class=&#34;sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image&#34; data-block-type=&#34;5&#34;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1459961244674_44558&#34; class=&#34;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&#34; data-block-type=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;sqs-block-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;The &amp;#8220;Fully Automated” Bookkeeping Service: Software+Human Touch&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      The third and final option which we will most definitely compare to a puppy being wrapped in a blanket—are software as a service options. This hybrid service provides the best of both worlds, giving users access to customized software as well as a dedicated bookkeeper. Instead of having to reconcile your own transactions, a bookkeeper (accountant) will do it for you. Some of these services like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jurnal.id&#34;&gt;Jurnal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, offer unlimited consultation at no hourly cost. Instead they prefer the more modern “Netflix” model of a monthly flat-rate fee. This gives business owners comfort, knowing the can reach out for advice without fear of incurring extra costs and make more accurate monthly budget predictions. Rather than a mean (tool) to an end, this option is a completely automated solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This option will not be for everyone, for example—extremely large and complicated corporations or accounting firms (just covering our bases). However for the other 90% of business owners—this type of bookkeeping service  is likely to be the most inclusive and cost effective. It offers all of the good (and more) of the aforementioned methods without the bad. The hybrid mixture of cloud-based tech combined with a human element of a bookkeeper takes away the headache of navigating tax law and entering data—while still providing a high touch high tech solution to your bookkeeping service needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Everything Entrepreneurs Should Know About Bookkeeping – Part 1</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/07/everything-entrepreneurs-know-bookkeeping-part-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;block-d42f7be9d9a26436dffc&#34; class=&#34;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&#34; data-block-type=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;sqs-block-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The term &amp;#8220;bookkeeping&amp;#8221; might conjure up scenes from a classic gangster flick, with back-alley deals, horse betting, and offers &amp;#8220;you can&amp;#8217;t refuse.&amp;#8221; But the reality is that this couldn&amp;#8217;t be farther from the truth. Sure, we have our fair share of excitement—an unreconciled transaction or an uncategorized charge (we kid, we kid). Bookkeeping is an arduous and time consuming process, a marathon that begins the day you open for business, to the day you (hopefully never) close your doors.&lt;br /&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      The purpose of this article is to give business owners a full overview of what bookkeeping entails so that they can &lt;strong&gt;A. implement proper bookkeeping practices&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;B. decide which bookkeeping methodology to use (yes, there&amp;#8217;s more than one way to keep your books&amp;#8230;)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;C. decide if it&amp;#8217;s something you really can and &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;do. &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;sqs-block-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      What is Bookkeeping?
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bookkeeping is simply keeping tabs on all of your financial transactions pertaining to business expenses. Or for the real nerds out there (and don&amp;#8217;t worry, that includes most of us here in the office), here&amp;#8217;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping&#34;&gt;Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;answer:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business. Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation. There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, such as the single-entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry bookkeeping system, but, while they may be thought of as &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    &lt;h2&gt;
      Is Bookkeeping Necessary?
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Yes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      We thought about buttering up our answer a million different ways—but in the end, the three letter word &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; is the correct response. Whether you own a &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;web design company&lt;/a&gt;, niche &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.popramennews.com/&#34;&gt;pop culture news site&lt;/a&gt; or a multi-billion dollar &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ford.com/&#34;&gt;car company&lt;/a&gt;—you need to implement proper bookkeeping techniques.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      How you go about doing your books is up to you, but even if you don&amp;#8217;t use a 3rd party bookkeeping service you must keep solid records of business transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Why?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Because if you don&amp;#8217;t, not only could you lose out on thousands of dollars in potential deductions—you could also lose compliance with the IRS. If the latter happens, not only will you not be eligible for deductions, you might end up owing the IRS money.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h2&gt;
      What are Good Bookkeeping Practices?
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Rather than list a million things you should be doing, we will list some of the most common bookkeeping pitfalls and how you can avoid them, starting with unreconciled transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Unreconciled transactions
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Do you have unreconciled transactions on your books? Your books cannot be complete until all transactions that occurred in 2015 are categorized correctly. Solution? Think and act chronologically.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Loan payments
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Do you have loan payments on your books? You may not have accounted for the principle and interest portions of the payments correctly. If you have categorized the whole payment to a single expense, your books are probably incorrect. Make sure you always account for the principle, as well as interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;
      The infamous “shoe box”
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Simply put, if your receipts are sitting in a box somewhere, then you haven’t even begun to keep your books. There is really no way to reconcile this pitfall except for to suggest that business owners abandon this practice and implement correct accounting principles from the beginning. Trust us when we say, it’s a lot easier to start documenting your transactions from the start, than to go through a year of coffee stained receipts to try and categorize transactions you may or may not remember.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Inventory count
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your books may have inaccurate values for inventory and Cost of Goods. This can be due to a miscount or, just as common, theft. This is especially important for business owners who have a physical product. Always stay current on inventory, and December 31 is always a good date to do a proper inventory check. This is a crucial step as you aim to properly keep your books.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Payroll
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Like a bicycle wheel, you’re payroll needs truing. Such maintenance requires that your income statement show payroll at gross but without a manual adjustment to the standard bank feeds, this account is probably only shown at net payroll.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Accrual basis bookkeeping
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      There are numerous accounts that need to be manually updated at year-end. This task is often far too difficult if you do not have an accounting background. It’s best to discuss this process with a CPA or accountant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/2016/07/everything-entrepreneurs-know-bookkeeping-part-2/&#34;&gt;↪ Continue&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>VPS vs Shared: The Pros &amp; Cons</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/vps-vs-shared-pros-cons/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 12:03:43 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/vps-vs-shared-pros-cons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared Hosting is the cheapest type of hosting available. Majority of websites and blogs use Shared Hosting owing to its low price. Individuals who intend to get themselves on the Web, usually go with this type of hosting, or in other words, ‘hosting for newbies.’ VPS on the other hand, is a &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; fortified type of hosting, and you can get your own IP address with the same. Still can’t make up your mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, both VPS and Shared Hosting have their own benefits. Gauge your requirements and make your decision regarding which type of Hosting is conducive to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Make Money From Blogging</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/make-money-blogging/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 16:06:47 &#43;0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone who loves to write fantasizes about making a living through words. Here are some tips on how to make blogging for money a reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;more-4512&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing can seem like a dream job. Journalists and copywriters may not be particularly well-paid, but many are self-employed and working from home, producing content on subjects they find interesting or know a great deal about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging represents the easiest route into professional writing, without needing a journalist’s technical skills or a copywriter’s instinctive talent for making any subject sound interesting. However, the exponential growth in blogging during this decade means that many thousands of enthusiastic amateurs are already writing for love rather than money. Even those  whose blogs generate income usually have other revenue sources to fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have any hope of generating revenue in today’s ultra-competitive blogosphere, it’s crucial to obey the following rules from the outset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it regularly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the volume of online content nowadays, sporadic blogs won’t retain audience levels. Uploading content on a daily basis will ensure people always have a reason to revisit your blog, saving the page in their Favorites and anticipating the next entry or update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it knowledgeably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A genuine passion for your chosen subject/s will make the content stand out and appeal to like-minded individuals. It’s almost impossible to fake interest in something, and audiences will soon migrate elsewhere if they identify a lack of knowledge or passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it professionally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amateur bloggers normally set up a WordPress or BlogSpot address, but this will cut little ice among potential sponsors or affiliates. A more professional approach involves registering a suitable website address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do check your spelling and grammar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, grammatical slip-ups and erratic spelling were less harmful to a blog’s prospects. Nowadays there’s far too much competition for such amateurishness. Proofread and spell-check everything before uploading it, and double-check every fact or statistic for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it publicly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making money from blogging is incredibly difficult, but it’s practically impossible without significant audience numbers. Take every opportunity to promote each new blog through social media posts, and invite comments from readers, reciprocal links with other bloggers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even adhering to these five steps, it’s reasonable to assume that your first year of blogging will be unpaid. As audience numbers increase and your blog establishes a reputation for engaging and original content, opportunities to generate revenue may then arise. Drop any thoughts of selling banner advertising at this stage since a website needs to receive hundreds of thousands of monthly impressions to interest digital advertising agencies and their blue-chip clients. It’s also advisable to stay away from those tacky ‘now trending’ clickbait ads if you want to maintain a professional image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bloggers generate revenue through affiliate marketing. This involves sponsored copy that promotes or reviews products and services, with commission generated by people clicking through from your blog. Although this dilutes the impartiality of your blog, affiliate marketing represents a key way to raise income from self-published online content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-money-from-blogging&#34;&gt;Make Money From Blogging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs can also be used as promotional tools for your own products and services, such as a computer hardware specialist who writes about strange IT issues and bizarre requests for assistance. Some people can turn blogs into books, repackaging existing content in a more dynamic form; a number of food bloggers have secured themselves publishing deals on the back of original recipes and online culinary advice. Finally, established bloggers may be approached by corporate clients, to generate content for third-party sites or to act as freelance consultants. Blogging becomes a means to an end in this scenario, creating brand awareness of your knowledge and expertise that opens doors to related opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guide to A Secure Password</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/guide-secure-password/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 15:54:42 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/guide-secure-password/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative ways to generate a rock solid password AND remember it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;more-4518&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day of fifth grade, each student in class was asked to stand up in front of the class and say his or her name and state one thing about himself or herself. When my turn came, I stood proudly and said, “My name is Mike, and I’m weird.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs Macaulay, in quintessential fifth grade teacher fashion, quickly corrected this with an optimistic “You’re not weird, you’re unique!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fifth grade opinion of myself, in Mrs Macaulay’s words, is just how we should all approach passwords. They should be as unique as possible, therefore making them harder to crack. But how can we make a password that’s just as random as my story about the first day of fifth grade, eluding hackers like Harry Potter wearing his invisibility cloak? Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It IS the size of the ship,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how you sail it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer your password is and the more characters it contains, the more complex it will be. Most websites that focus on security recommend a 12-character minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ain’t ain’t a word cuz it ain’t in the dictionary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ‘ain’t’ eventually wriggled its way into most modern dictionaries, your password never should. Avoid using any real words as they will be easier to hack – if a hacker can find part or all of your password in the dictionary, it will be that much easier to enter into password hacking software and breach your security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capitalize on options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a no-brainer, but throwing capital letters into the mix greatly increases the complexity of your password; adding them at random places within the password, instead of just at the beginning, makes it even tougher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaht is your passvord? Ha, ha, ha. – Count von Count, Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. If you were to use the full alpha set of letters, there would be 53,459,728,531,456 possible combinations for a password. Add the 10 numerical characters to that and your possibilities for password combos jumps to a whopping 218,340,105,584,896! Come on, hackers, I dare you to try to figure out 218 trillion plus combinations to find mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power of $ymbols&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some websites that insist on ultra-tough passwords will require you to include at least one symbol to lock down your password. Adding symbols into the mix adds even more potential combinations for your password. The characters on the numerical keys – !@#$%^&amp;amp;*() – are a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generations worth of ideas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Password generators will quickly come up with a random combination of characters that will be especially elusive to anyone trying to figure out your password. Just make sure you’re using a trusted generator – as soon as your password is created then there are two of you who know it: the password generation software and you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different site, different solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a different password for each website that requires one will keep bad guys guessing…and guessing…and guessing. But it can be difficult to remember all those random strings of letters, numbers, and symbols, each one almost as random as that Harry Potter reference (didn’t think I would let that go unmentioned, did you?). That leads us to our next tip…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manage expectations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Password manager software (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lastpass.com/&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://keepass.info/&#34;&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;) is a great tool to employ if you want to have a different password for many different sites, but you don’t think you’ll be able to remember all of them. Password managers store all of your passwords, then create a single master password that you can use to enter any site. Just input your master password and the password manager will swap it out for the correct one, all safe, sound, and secure. This way you can have mega-random passwords, each more complex than the next, but will only have to remember one password yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;guide-to-a-secure-password&#34;&gt;Guide to A Secure Password&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never stop hearing about cyber security in the news these days, and as such having a secure password has never been more important. Use the simple tips above and your passwords will be harder to figure out than even my fifth grade self-esteem. Still working on cracking that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Tips For Ecommerce Website</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/5-tips-ecommerce-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 15:45:03 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2016/05/5-tips-ecommerce-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your e-commerce site lacking something? Apply these 5 tips to your website to start seeing more conversions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;more-2104&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re running an online business, chances are you’ve looked for ways to improve your e-commerce website. Making certain changes on your site might just be what you need to turn hesitant visitors into long-term customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where do you begin? With so many different aspects you can change, what’s the best way to start the process of yielding positive results right away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together what we consider to be 5 of the most important aspects for an e-commerce site in today’s world. Check these tips out, and decide which ones you want to apply to your own website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your site mobile friendly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of your visitors will use their mobile device to find your website. In fact, according to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/surprising-mobile-ecommerce/&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; done by Kissmetrics, 55% of e-commerce shopping is done using either a smartphone or tablet. In other words, it’s an absolute necessity to make sure that your site’s visitors can easily navigate your website with their mobile device. In addition to improving user experience, having a mobile-friendly site is also important for helping you rank high with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Keep your checkout process simple&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried purchasing something online, but given up due to an over-complicated checkout process? It happens often, and asking for too much information as the customer is checking out can be a major cause for this. On your checkout page, only ask for essential details from your customers. Avoid having a ten-step process that asks them to subscribe to your email list, refer a friend and then take a 10-question survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Pay attention to analytics&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data can be your best friend when it comes to knowing what you need to improve. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/analytics/&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource for finding out how your ads are performing, as well as tracking how visitors find your site. &lt;a href=&#34;https://kissmetrics.com/&#34;&gt;Kissmetrics&lt;/a&gt; is another great tool that can help you determine what’s working for your e-commerce site, and what can be improved. If you’re using WordPress, Woocommerce is an easy-to-use e-commerce platform that comes packed with analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Clear call-to-action buttons&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your visitors should never have to search for where they should click next when they want to make a purchase. Make your call-to-action buttons obvious and apparent. You don’t need to have a giant “Click Here” statement in the middle of your page, but you should have a noticeable button that will lead your visitors to sign up for your email list, or even better, make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Offer support&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one likes feeling that they’ll be dropped as soon as they finalize their online purchase. On your e-commerce site, make it known that you back up your product or service and that you are willing to help your customers, especially after they click that ‘Submit Order’ button. If you’re running an online tech business, such as reselling domain names or web hosting, make sure your visitors know that if they choose your service, you’ll provide reliable and ongoing tech support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce can be a challenge, but if you apply the right techniques you can see a big boost in online business. If you don’t have your e-commerce site set up quite yet, make sure to take these tips into account to put your online store above the competition!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Things to do before buying a domain</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/12/things-buying-domain/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 07:09:19 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/12/things-buying-domain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;postcontents&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Domains are relatively easy to purchase: You just head over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;your favorite registrar&lt;/a&gt;, type in the domain you’re interested in, and as long as it’s available, it can be yours with a few clicks of a button. But the real work comes &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you make your purchase..
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you want to register a great domain name that will set you up for success in the long run, perform these things to do before buying a domain before hitting the “&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;Purchase&lt;/span&gt;” button.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Give yourself time to really think about your domain name before committing to one
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Things to do before buying a domain. Your first idea for a domain name may not be your best one. Give yourself time to think over possibilities and come up with several options to choose from. After all, a great domain name is the foundation of a good website. It should be memorable, easy to type, and effectively share your brand. Also, think beyond traditional domain endings and consider using a New Domain. Not only does it offer you the chance to create a uniquely branded URL, but it also has a lot more availability than traditional domain names.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Determine how you’ll be using your domain
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Things to do before buying a domain. You have several options for how to use your domain once it’s registered. The most obvious way to use it is as the primary URL for a new website—but that’s not your only option. You can maximize your online presence by pointing your domain to a variety of other places. Highlight a specific section of your website through a customized domain (for example, showcase your philanthropy efforts with a yoursite.gives domain), or make it easy for new followers to find you on social media with a yoursite.social domain name.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Make sure you’re not infringing on someone else’s trademark
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Things to do before buying a domain. There’s always a possibility that the brilliant, perfect, one-of-a-kind domain name you’ve come up with isn’t as unique as you thought. If it turns out that your domain is the same or very similar to trademarked content, you could be in big trouble down the road. It’s worth the extra effort to do your research ahead of time to make sure you aren’t infringing upon someone else’s intellectual property. A quick Google search is a good place to start, but you can also use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uspto.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website&lt;/a&gt; to do more in-depth research. Nolo.com also offers a comprehensive guide for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/avoid-trademark-infringement-domain-name-29032.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;understanding if your domain name infringes on a trademark&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2&gt;
    See if social handles of the same (or a similar) name are available
  &lt;/h2&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Social media is now an essential part of curating an online presence. You want it to be as easy as possible for your website visitors to find and follow you on other social networks. Having a consistent handle across your website and social media accounts streamlines your online presence and is a great way to brand yourself. With the right tools, it doesn’t take a lot of work to determine if a name is available across the board. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.name.com/blog/business/social-media-2/2015/09/rembrandt-social-media-branding-made-easy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Download the Chrome extension Rembrandt&lt;/a&gt; and whenever you search for a domain name on intispace.com, you’ll automatically see if the same handles are available on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Easy ways to create a sitemap</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/08/easy-ways-to-create-a-sitemap/</link>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-sitemap&#34;&gt;What is a sitemap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sitemap is a document that lists all URLs of your website that you would like crawled by a search engine. Most often, this document gives additional details such as the date a page was last modified, how frequently a page may change, and whether the page should be given priority over others, I will show you all the easy ways to create a sitemap..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-i-need-a-sitemap&#34;&gt;Why do I need a sitemap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all become accustomed to using a search engine, probably daily. We often “Google” our questions throughout the day. Sitemaps are important because they tell search engines what pages are available for crawling on the website. They help search engines navigate your website and with this, your content is indexed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering how sitemaps work, since it is kind of an abstract concept. Think of it this way, your website is a building, and the sitemap is the blueprint that explains where all the parts of the structure are. An important addition to any site, they are easy to create and once they are set up, do not require a lot of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-the-search-engines-find-the-sitemap&#34;&gt;How do the search engines find the sitemap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your sitemap is set up, search engines don’t automatically find it. To have your site indexed, a submittal process is required. The process is easy, and this can be accomplished in just a few simple steps. There are others, but the two major search engines to start with are Google and Bing. Easy ways to create a sitemap, once you have your sitemap ready, you can do this by setting up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bing Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt; account. After the accounts are setup, you will be able to walk through step by step to get your sitemap submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-create-a-sitemap&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to create a sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;small-website-solution-manual-option&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small website solution manual option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XML-Sitemaps&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that will generate a sitemap for you. Currently, it will generate up to 500 pages. This option works best for small websites that are not updated frequently since it requires manual updating each time a page is added or removed. It’s worth mentioning in case your preference is to be up and running quickly and don’t mind doing the manual work of creating and moving the sitemap file. If you want to create something fast, or are just curious about what a sitemap looks like, it is easy to generate one. All you have to do is enter your URL and it takes care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12277&#34; src=&#34;http://getflywheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/xml-sitemap-generator.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;xml-sitemap-generator&#34; width=&#34;1022&#34; height=&#34;272&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the generator has created your sitemap, you need to upload it to the root of your domain; the URL will be something like www.yoursite.com/sitemap.xml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wordpress-specific-solutions-for-sitemaps&#34;&gt;WordPress specific solutions for sitemaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know how awesome WordPress is and that there are many great plugins available. Although there is nothing wrong with manually creating a sitemap, it can be a pain if you have to do this all of the time. With sitemap specific plugins, there is no need to manually create your own. Although there are many options (and opinions!) out there, these two have been chosen as great options for an automatic solution to get you up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoast’s WordPress SEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may already be using WordPress SEO by Yoast. If so, it does have a sitemap generator built right into it. It is very easy to setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12278&#34; src=&#34;http://getflywheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/yoast-plugin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;yoast-plugin&#34; width=&#34;1022&#34; height=&#34;1266&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see an extensive option list that can be customized to your liking. If there are specific post types and taxonomies that you would like excluded, that is an option. If you have a very large site, Yoast has the capability to only include the specified number of URL’s listed on a page, which is less strain on your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing is, this plugin takes care of the generating and publishing of the sitemap. It will be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml&#34;&gt;http://www.yoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml&lt;/a&gt;. The main sitemap page lists a sitemap for each post type. It lists all the URLs that you would like crawled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google XML Sitemap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google XML Sitemaps&lt;/a&gt; is another great option. Google XML Sitemaps gives you extra information like details of when your sitemap was last generated, and it also has the capability to calculate the priority for each post by looking at the number of comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-12275&#34; src=&#34;http://getflywheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/google-xml-sitemaps.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;google-xml-sitemaps&#34; width=&#34;1022&#34; height=&#34;653&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does require a bit of setup to get up and running. The main settings page has options so you can create the perfect sitemap. Most of the configuration settings can be modified on this same page. Like Yoast, you can easily choose what to exclude. In addition to choosing the number of posts that are listed, you can increase the memory limit and execution time for the sitemap creation process, making this a flexible option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plugin will publish and update the sitemap automatically, so once things are set up, you do not have to do anything else, that easy ways to create a sitemap by default, this is the path to the sitemap: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yoursite.com/index.xml&#34;&gt;http://www.yoursite.com/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good practice to have a sitemap, and as an extra motivator, it’s worth mentioning the fact that there are SEO benefits to having one. On your journey to sitemapping, you will find that there are easy options for creating a sitemap, including great WordPress specific plugins that update and grow along with your site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MAKE SURE YOUR MOVERS ARE PROFESSIONALS</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/07/make-sure-your-movers-are-professionals/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 09:22:48 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/07/make-sure-your-movers-are-professionals/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had to move, you know how difficult it can be. It doesn’t matter if you’re moving your website to a new host or your family to a new house. Even if your current location causes you a lot of stress, the pain of moving somewhere new can make it seem worthwhile to stay in a place you’re not happy. Moving doesn’t have to be a massive difficulty for you, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old friend, Christian Dubois moved his houses earlier this week. To help alleviate the pain, he hired professionals. He did research on moving companies, discovering that many hire part-time or seasonal employees. That terrified him. Some people may say stuff is just stuff, but it’s my stuff and much of it is very important to me. He was hiring professionals to reduce his stress, not simply replace it with the worry that inexperienced movers might break things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving hosting sucks, make sure your movers are professionals. When people move from an old host to Intispace, we know the process can be stressful. No one wants to escape a bad host only to find their website doesn’t work properly on the new one. That’s why we train our expert staff to move people safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s your home, your business, or your website, moving sucks. Working with trusted professionals like Intispace lets you relax while they take care of all the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maximize Your Marketing Potential</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/maximize-your-marketing-potential/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2015 12:15:42 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/maximize-your-marketing-potential/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it worth it for a marketer to become technical, creative and analytical? Read why dedicating time to expanding your skillset will only improve your overall success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;more-1625&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing is a broad field. It is not just about search engine optimization, it isn’t just expanding reach on social media and it definitely isn’t just advertising. Marketing pulls several different components together to form a profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximize Your Marketing Potential! One of the most important aspects of a well-rounded marketer that is commonly overlooked is having the necessary technical skills. A marketer might ask: why should I learn how to code if I can hire a developer? Or why should I spend time developing my writing skills if I can hire a copywriter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why it pays to expand your skillset, the first being that you may not be in a position to be hiring other people to work for you. In fact, you may very well be the one &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; hired. When it comes to this, having a wide range of skills will set you apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 7 skills that every marketer (or hopeful entrepreneur) should aim to develop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web technology and development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)&lt;/strong&gt; – Having a strong grasp on these basic coding languages will benefit you greatly and help you create a strong web presence. Even if you go the route of using a Content Management Software (CMS), you’ll still need to understand how HTML and CSS work. Your website, or the sites you help clients create, will never be up to par if you don’t have a confident base in web development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web design/UX design&lt;/strong&gt; – Although similar to web development, web design and UX design focus on how your audience will interact with a website or web app. Knowing what kind of typography works best or the ideal location of a CTA (Call To Action) can drastically improve how a user browses a webpage. Start by learning how to make sitemaps and wireframes and then deepen your design skills from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn new software&lt;/strong&gt; – This may depend on the type of work you’ll be doing, but we suggest starting with the Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator). Everything from hopeful startups to Fortune 500 companies use programs like Photoshop. In addition to this, become an expert with Excel; this dramatically helps with the following tip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; – Evaluating results and testing what is and isn’t working is crucial for a marketer. If something isn’t working you’re more likely to know about it if you have the data as evidence. From this data you can figure out what changes are needed to improve it. And of course if something is working well, the proof is in the data. I had a marketing professor that always said, “In God we trust. All others bring data”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; – Search Engine Optimization is a key role for all marketers. In today’s digital age your targeted audience must be able to find you online. How much will your revenue increase if a potential customer finds your site at the top of their Google search? Yeah, SEO is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copywriting&lt;/strong&gt; – We can all agree that not everyone writes well. However, writing is a skill that can be developed and as with any other kind of skill, practice makes perfect. Don’t be afraid to express your creativity in the copy that you write. This is one of the major opportunities you have to reach out and connect with your audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Databases/SQL&lt;/strong&gt; – Understanding databases can help you pull the data you need to analyze and put it to use. Being able to at least process SQL will give you the ability to look through a database. When you feel more comfortable with it you can even create your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media&lt;/strong&gt; – Ten years ago, no one would have taken a marketer who focused only on social media seriously. Now, it’s essential for all marketers to understand how to build a strong social presence. Effectively using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google+ can boost your business from an unknown startup to the next Pebble smartwatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web hosting&lt;/strong&gt; – As a marketer you may be responsible for getting a site live and making sure it functions properly. You might not be involved with profound server-side protocols, but you should at least understand the basics of hosting, including FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branding&lt;/strong&gt; – Let’s not forget one of the staple attributes of a good marketer: the ability to brand a product or service. This seems simple to some, but large corporations pay top marketers hundreds of thousands of dollars to build their brand. What makes companies like Apple or Nike or North Face so elite? It boils down to the image that they’ve created for themselves through outstanding marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You of course can’t learn all of these skills in only a couple of weeks. It may take years to finally grasp new and foreign concepts such as SEO and JavaScript. However, dedicating the time to learn will only make you a better marketer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To market your business online you need to start by registering a domain name and host a site. See how &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;Intispace Netmedia&lt;/a&gt; can help you start your online business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Image Optimization, An Easy Win For A Faster Site</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/image-optimization-an-easy-win-for-a-faster-site/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 00:05:27 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/image-optimization-an-easy-win-for-a-faster-site/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Website speed optimization can be a complex and technical practice, but the non-techies out there will be happy to learn that one of the biggest problems is actually easy for the layperson to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-images&#34;&gt;The Problem With Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image Optimization, An Easy Win For A Faster Site. Images are typically the one of the biggest drains on page load time. Even with caching and a CDN, an unoptimized image will still drag down your page loading time. But, as the website owner, images are completely under your control, so if you can get a handle on how to work with and optimize images, you can have a great impact on the speed of your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the websites that I look at during my Intispace customer support duties, I see that images contribute, on average, about 30% of the total page load time. Often this is the single largest factor of the loading time. In extreme cases, it could be closer to 60% of the loading time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what un-optimized images will do to your site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-431  lazyautosizes lazyloaded&#34; src=&#34;http://cdn.wp-rocket.me/wp-content/uploads/4/pingdom-image-slow-site.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Large Images slow down your website&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;108&#34; data-lazy-src=&#34;http://cdn.wp-rocket.me/wp-content/uploads/4/pingdom-image-slow-site.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The load time is 12 seconds and the size of the page is 8MB. Of those 8MB, images account for 6.7MB. This is out of control!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of http requests is commonly cited as a factor in load time, and while it is important, ultimately it’s the page size that is the real indicator of speed or slowness. You can have a small number of http requests, but if those requests are summoning giant images, you will have a problem on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-dimensions-and-file-size&#34;&gt;Understanding Dimensions and File Size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dimensions of the image, i.e. how much space on the screen an image takes up, are measured in pixels and while they do not 100% dictate file size, they are related. The larger the dimensions of your image, the larger the file size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File size is measured in kilobytes (KB) and megabytes (MB)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1MB = 1000KB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a point of reference, the main content column of this blog is 796 pixels wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a photo with your smartphone, depending on your settings, that photo could be in the region of 2500 pixels wide (or even more) with a filesize of 3MB (or 3000KB). If I were to take a photo with my phone and upload it to this blog without any editing, I’m going to be uploading a file that is about 3 times as big as it needs to be – a total waste of resources and a drag on page load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while snapping phone pics and uploading to your blog might be simple, it creates a real problem if you want a fast site,  by adding tons of unnecessary weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resizing-images&#34;&gt;Resizing Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing you need to do is resize your images to the correct size for your site. For blog images, figure out how wide your blog’s content area is  and never upload an image wider than that. If it’s going to be used in a slider, make sure you determine the dimensions of the slider first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know how wide your content area is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know how to use the developer tools built in to Chrome or Firefox, you can use that. But if that sounds scary there are simpler tools available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a Mac, there is a screen capture tool, Grab, already built-in, and when you outline an area on the screen it will tell you the pixels. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aeyoun.com/posts/osx-screen-shot-ruler.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;This article explains in more detail.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;install the easy Page Ruler addon  for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve figured out what dimensions your images should be, you can use any of the below tools to resize your images accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resizing Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP – free, Windows &amp;amp; Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irfan View- free for Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview for Mac – it’s already installed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers on Macs can &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sips.1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;check out sips, a command line tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Tools For Resizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picmonkey.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixlr.com (also has mobile app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fotor.com (also has mobile app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter which one you use – all you need to do is locate the resize feature. You’ll be able to enter the desired pixel width and the application will make sure the image stays in proportion by adjusting the height automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;image-formats&#34;&gt;Image Formats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images on the web should be saved in either .jpg, .png, or possibly .gif&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPEGs&lt;/strong&gt; are best used for photographs and general purpose images where you do not need any transparency. You can compress them easily and get a smaller filesize suitable for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PNGs&lt;/strong&gt; will often generate a larger filesize so should only be used when you have an image that requires transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIFs&lt;/strong&gt; are less frequently used. They have a limited range of color so can only be used for very simple images, but can produce a small filesize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;compressing-images&#34;&gt;Compressing Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve dealt with the physical dimensions of the image, now let’s deal with the ‘weight’ of the image. We want to compress the image to make it as lean and fast-loading as possible. &lt;strong&gt;The goal is to reduce the filesize&lt;/strong&gt;. There isn’t a magic number as to what each image should be, since it depends on how the image will be used. Images being used in a hero banner or slider will be bigger, but if you have a few of them, I’d aim to get each one down to 100KB or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small images that are going to be used for thumbnails, logos etc will be much much smaller. The logo at the top of this blog, for example, is 3.8KB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With compression there may be a slight loss in quality, so you’re looking for a balance between quality and file size. But always remember that the smaller the filesize, the faster the load time will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoshop – make sure to use the &lt;em&gt;Save For Web&lt;/em&gt; option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ImageOptim (Mac)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compressor.io – make sure to choose the ‘lossy’ option for the biggest size reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wordpress-plugins&#34;&gt;WordPress Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s preferable to resize and compress your image before you upload it to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if your site is already live, you will need to deal with the images that are already there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the crucial images such as logos, headers and others that load on every page of your site, it would be best to make new versions of the images as described above, then install the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Enable Media Replace plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This will allow you to simply replace existing images in your media library with the new, optimized ones, without breaking any links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the other images sitting in your media library, where it would be unrealistic to go through and fix them all individually,there are a few handy plugins that will help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EWWW Image Optimizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plugin can go through your existing media library and compress everything in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you build sites for clients or have a site with multiple users where you cannot ensure that everyone is using best practices and uploading nicely optimized images, the below plugins will help mitigate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/imsanity/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Imsanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can determine the settings so that if someone uploads a gigantic image, it will automatically be reduced to maximum size of your choosing. No more 4000 pixel images clogging up the media library!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/tiny-compress-images/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Compress JPEG &amp;amp; PNG Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once set up, this uses the TinyPNG API to automatically compress images on upload. You can get a free API key for up to 500 images/month which would be plenty for the average blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to benchmark the speed of your site, or do before/after comparisons with images after optimizing, &lt;a title=&#34;How To Correctly Measure Your Website’s Page Load Time&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/?p=33279&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;follow this guide on how to properly measure the load time of your site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Measure Your Website’s Page Load Time</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/how-to-measure-your-websites-page-load-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 00:00:04 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/how-to-measure-your-websites-page-load-time/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When assessing the effectiveness of CDN, W3 Total Cache or any other WordPress caching plugin, it’s important that you are able to correctly measure the page loading time of your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several tools available for How To Measure Your Website’s Page Load Time. Our favorite, and the one we think is most accurate, is Pingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-pingdom&#34;&gt;How To Use Pingdom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert info&#34;&gt;
  Visit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tools.pingdom.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://tools.pingdom.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click Settings and choose the location closest to your web server, not your own physical location. Paste in your website URL and click Test Now.&lt;span id=&#34;more-283&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pingdom will summarize your web page performance at the top with 4 metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance grade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-286  lazyautosizes lazyloaded&#34; src=&#34;http://cdn.wp-rocket.me/wp-content/uploads/4/Website-speed-test-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pindgom website speed test&#34; width=&#34;639&#34; height=&#34;553&#34; data-lazy-src=&#34;http://cdn.wp-rocket.me/wp-content/uploads/4/Website-speed-test-1.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these metrics, the most important is load time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grade is a general guideline of how well your site is optimized, but it’s not important to get a perfect score there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed at which your site loads is really the only number that matters. When Google is visiting your site, it does not care or know about the performance grade, only the loading time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-an-accurate-average&#34;&gt;Getting An Accurate Average&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should run the test several times to get an average loading time since it will not be identical every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have just added caching to your site, or have changed any options in your caching plugin, the first time a visitor (including a Pingdom bot) hits your page (unless it’s been preloaded), they will get a non-cached version of the page. That visit causes the cache to be generated, so the next visitor will get the faster, cached version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you run the speed test, the first result could possibly be on a non-cached version of your page which is why it’s important to run the test a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intispace + Cloudflare will preload the homepage of your site and the pages linked from it when you either manually click the Preload button, when the cache has expired or when you create or update a post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when you create/update content the cache is deleted and preloaded a few seconds later for associated content such as category and tag archive pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you simply use the Clear Cache feature or just save the settings, the preload won’t get triggered. So either trigger it manually, or just visit your website to generate the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people only test the homepage of their site which typically has a lot more content on it than a regular page or post. So consider testing various types of content on your site to get a more well-rounded view of how fast your site is as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On many websites, visitors finding the site from a search engine will enter your site on a blog post or individual page, not necessarily the homepage, so the performance of all pages needs to be fast. You’ll probably find that those internal posts/pages load faster than your homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;benchmarking&#34;&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really see how much improvement you’re getting from your caching plugin you need to benchmark your site without any caching plugins first by running the above tests and taking an average page load time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add your caching plugin with its most basic configuration and run the tests a few more times to get a comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time you activate a new option in the plugin you need to see if it has an impact – for better or worse, so you need to test each change that you make, in the above manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people turn on W3 Total Cache for example and enable ALL the additional options but find some slowness. This could be because additional options such as minification and others have the potential to conflict with themes, plugins and server configurations and should be used cautiously. They are not always necessary. Just turning on the plugin will give you the most significant speed boost. The additional options are just that – optional. They are not always necessary and should always be tested to see if they are giving you additional improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing after every change lets you isolate a particular feature that may be causing an issue. This is true of W# Total Cache or any of the other caching plugins you may use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure you don’t have multiple caching plugins running at once. For example, even if WP Super Cache is installed but not activated, it can still interfere so it needs to be fully deleted before testing a different plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-waterfall-chart&#34;&gt;The Waterfall Chart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waterfall shows you the loading time of each component of your page – all the various image files, CSS, Javascript files etc that are loaded each time someone visits your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a caching plugin such as W3 Total Cache you should be getting a fast loading time, but the waterfall chart can help you identify any bottlenecks or problematic files. Sometimes it only takes a couple of large images or external scripts to drag down the loading time of your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the dropdown at the top of the waterfall and choose “Sort By Load Time”. This will show you the longest loading files at the top, making problem files easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External scripts such as those from third party ad servers etc are probably your biggest enemy here. Since those scripts are not coming from your server there is no caching you can do on them – you are at the mercy of their server. You can see that in this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-285 aligncenter  lazyautosizes lazyloaded&#34; src=&#34;http://cdn.wp-rocket.me/wp-content/uploads/4/sort-by-load-time.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pingdom - Sort By Load Time&#34; width=&#34;639&#34; height=&#34;114&#34; data-lazy-src=&#34;http://cdn.wp-rocket.me/wp-content/uploads/4/sort-by-load-time.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intispace Platform Improvements, And How You Benefit</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/intispace-platform-improvements-and-how-you-benefit/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 13:43:13 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/intispace-platform-improvements-and-how-you-benefit/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One of our goals here at Intispace is to continue innovating and improving our platform so you can get the absolute most out of it. And late last year and early this year we made a host of intispace platform improvements to our platform that give all Intispace customers better performance, tighter security, and updated caching. Intispace Platform Improvements, And How You Benefit, Combined, these improvements result in faster, more reliable, and more secure WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a quick look at some of our recent platform improvements and how you benefit from them as a Intispace customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;performance&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intispace Platform Improvements, And How You Benefit. We’re in the process of updating our platform to PHP 5.5, Ubuntu 14.04, and MySQL 5.6. These upgrades individually deliver huge performance gains, and when combined they can account for nearly a 50 percent increase in speed for our customers. Thousands of our customers have already been moved into the new platform, and all new customers are on this platform already.  We continue to actively migrate customers, and we’ll send you an email as part of the migration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also improved our performance monitoring and our hotspot identification and now use it to actively drive performance improvements in our platform. Proactive performance monitoring helps us identify customers who may have performance issues. Our team digs in and finds the root cause of the issue and pushes the improvements upstream–into WordPress, plugins, or our platform, which benefits a larger set of customers and allows us to drive  improvements in the performance and scalability of third-party plugins. So far, this effort has resulted in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvements to the way we do object caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvements to our baseline database configuration and schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several changes in third-party plugins to make them operate better at scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to improve our malicious traffic detection and blocking (web application firewall), which reduces overall server load and protects your WordPress sites from attackers. The attacks that we block include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploits against several plugins, such as the RevSlider vulnerability, that attempt unauthorized downloads of php files, configuration files, /etc/passwd, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempts to gain unauthorized access to wp-admin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This improvement was put into action recently and complete well before the public announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;caching&#34;&gt;Caching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also improved our caching for mobile sites by updating how our platform handles mobile search engine bots. Previously, mobile-specific bots could be served cached versions of non-mobile-optimized pages. This is an important improvement for sites that serve different content to mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These updates, and the updates we’re currently working on, reaffirm our commitment to all Intispace customers that we’ll continuously innovate and work on ways to intispace platform improvements&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Does SSL Protect My Website?</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/how-does-ssl-protect-my-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 17:12:19 &#43;0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/how-does-ssl-protect-my-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most economical and secure ways to protect your website on affordable hosting platforms is to deploy a private Secure Socket Layer (SSL) on you’re your website giving the instant ability to roll out protected URLs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mysite.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.mysite.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are still in doubt as to what an SSL actually does consider this explanation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=how-ssl-works&#34;&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt; on the digital handshake that takes place between a browser and a server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A browser attempts to connect to a website secured with SSL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser requests that the web server identify itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server sends the browser a copy of its SSL certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser checks whether it trusts the SSL certificate. If so, it sends a message to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgement to start an SSL 7 encrypted session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted data is shared between the browser and the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your site receives a permanent “security guard” which protects users in an online transaction, and encrypts data during transmission giving you, said Symantec, a “trillion year head start over a hacker.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At current computing speeds, a hacker with the time, tools, and motivation to attack using brute force would require a trillion years to break into a session protected by an SGC-enabled certificate,” said Symantec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To enable strong encryption for the most site visitors, choose an SSL Certificate that enables 128-bit minimum encryption for 99.9 percent of website visitors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other benefits, too, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credentials establish identity online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication generates trust in credential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSL certificates on Intispace platforms are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signed by Comodo, Geotrust, RapidSSL, Certum, Thawte, Symantec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;99.3% compatibility with browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;256-bit encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock appears in browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
